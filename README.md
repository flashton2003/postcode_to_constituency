# postcode_to_constituency

A quick bit of code to link postcode with constituency. Got the idea on how to implement from http://data.gov.uk/forum/general-discussion/mp-postcode-csv-file

Next step for me, will be to link constituency with demographic data from http://democraticdashboard.com/data/census/.
